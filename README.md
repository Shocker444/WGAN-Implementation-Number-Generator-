# WGAN-Implementation

  The Wasserstein GAN implementation proposed here https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875.
  
  This implementation lets the user generate a number of their choice by limiting the training set to the input number specified by the user. 
  
  Dataset trained on: Mnist dataset.
  
  Currently does not support training on other datasets except make changes yourself.

## To Test

  First clone the repository
  
  Then install the requirements "pip install requirements.txt"
  
  After, cd into the directory and run "python train.py" on your terminal.
